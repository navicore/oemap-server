# NOTES

1. only devices can join a map
1. merge `Person` and `Membership`
1. new type `Marker` - any member can add / edit / delete any marker
1. seeing the members of one map won't let you add them to a new map - 409
1. all person to person communication is out of band sharing url-shortener paths
1. no public maps
1. any map you are a member of can be copied with markers (but never members)
